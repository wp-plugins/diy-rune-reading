== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Why doesn't my widget work?

If it doesn't work then there's an issue on our end as this is a flash file hosted by our servers. So, effectiveness is pretty straight forward. Do let us know though if you have issues and we'll try to help if we have time.

2. I've clicked a rune but can't get back to my other runes?

Click the red "x" to exit out of selected cards.

3. Do I have to keep the link underneath the widget back to diydiscovery.com?

Yes, as long as you use the widget it is required.
